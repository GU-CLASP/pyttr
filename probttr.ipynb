For any such argument it returns either a probability constraint (e.g. `PConstraint(.6)`) or `None`.  As a python function the oracle may call on resources external to `pyttr`, for example, conditional probability tables or Bayesian networks.  A call `T.query(a,c,o)` where `c` does not contain `(a,TT)` where `TT` is a subtype of `T` will return `o(a,T,c)` if this is not `None`. Otherwise `T.query(a,c,o)` will return `T.query(a)` (the unconditional probability).  If `c` _does_ contain `(a,TT)` where `TT` is a subtype of `T`, then the oracle will be ignored and `T.query(a,c,o)` will return `PConstraint(1)`."
